# Getting Started

If this is your first time using GitWit, you've come to the right place.
Here we'll show you how to install and get started quickly.

To better understand what it is and what it's for, see [What is GitWit?](./what-is.md).

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing GitWit, make sure your environment meets the minimum requirements:

- Java JRE 21 or higher

GitWit is developed in Java, so you need the Java Runtime Environment installed.
To check your Java version, run:

```bash
java -version
```

- Git installed and configured

GitWit interacts directly with Git repositories, so having Git installed is essential. Verify the installation with:

```bash
git --version
```
